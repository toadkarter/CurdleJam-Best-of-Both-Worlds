# CurdleJam #34: Best of Both Worlds
This repository is intended for work on my submission to CurdleJam #34. The theme is Best of Both Worlds, so as of the time of me writing this ReadMe I am hoping to use some sort of dungeon puzzler with a light world / dark world mechanic.  

The current plan is to use this wonderful Zelda-esque [asset pack](https://ansimuz.itch.io/top-down-adventure-assets) as the main source of the art for this game.
